## News

- 23/01/2025, üî•TRACE has been accepted to ICLR 2025.
- 01/11/2024, üî•We are excited to announce the release of [trace-uni](https://huggingface.co/Yongxin-Guo/trace-uni), which has been enhanced by incorporating additional general video understanding data from a subset of [LLaVA-Video-178k](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lmms-lab/LLaVA-Video-178K). Our results indicate that (1) the TRACE architecture is still capable of handling general video understanding tasks (53.8 on MVBench and 49.6 on VideoMME); (2) *although not adding more VTG data*, trace-uni outperforms trace in *both VTG tasks and general video understanding tasks*. 
- 31/10/2024, üî• We evaluated the TRACE nodel on [VideoMME](https://video-mme.github.io/home_page.html) benchmark and updated the evaluation code.
- 25/10/2024, üî• We evaluated the TRACE model on the [MVBench](https://github.com/OpenGVLab/Ask-Anything) benchmark and updated the evaluation code accordingly. Our findings indicate that, *despite not being trained on extensive multi-task datasets*, TRACE is still capable of effectively handling general QA tasks.
- 19/10/2024, üî• We release [trace-retrieval](https://huggingface.co/Yongxin-Guo/trace-retrieval) by forcing the predicted timestamps to be align with the input frame timestamps. Results show trace-retrieval achieve better performance on dense video captioning tasks
- 10/10/2024, üî• Annotation files of training data are released!
- 10/10/2024, üî• Our model checkpoints and code are released!

TODO

- [x] Release the model checkpoints
- [x] Release the inference and evaluation code
- [x] Release the training and fine-tuning code
- [x] Release the training data
- [x] Release the TRACE-Retrieval, which outputs timestamps of input frames instead of predict unseen timestamps.
- [x] Train TRACE models on more tasks.

## Overview

In this work
- We model the videos by a series of events, and propose causal event modeling framework to capture videos' inherent structure.
- We present a novel task-interleaved video LLM model, TRACE, tailored to implement the causal event modeling framework through the sequential encoding/decoding of timestamps, salient scores, and textual captions.

## Enviroments

We use NPU environments for training and fine-tuning, and use V100 GPUs for evaluation. The environment we use can be found in [npu-requirements](./install_requirements-npu.sh) and [gpu-requirements](./requirements.txt).
