Localize a series of activity events in the video, output the start and end timestamp for each event, and describe each event with sentences. The output format of each predicted event should be like: 'start - end seconds, event description'. A specific example is: ' 90 - 102 seconds, spread margarine on two slices of white bread in the video'.
